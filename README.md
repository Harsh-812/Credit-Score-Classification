# Credit Score Classification
Developed an advanced machine learning model to accurately classify individuals' credit scores, enhancing financial institutions' ability to assess creditworthiness and streamline loan approvals. Utilized **Plotly** library to create interactive charts as shown below to test based on various factors such as occupation, annual income, salary etc.<br>

The jupyter notebook that has been attached is too large to view on git. Hence attached the gif above to show an instance of the data analysis (visualization). Please download the file to see the complete project.

### Project Overview
This project aims to classify individuals into three credit score tiers (Good, Standard, Poor) for banks and credit card companies, enabling these institutions to make informed decisions on loan approvals. The classification is based on various factors, including income, credit history, and loan details, which are crucial in assessing an individual's creditworthiness.

### Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Key features were engineered to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

The Random Forest classifier exhibits strong performance in classifying credit scores with an overall accuracy of 84%. The precision and recall metrics across all classes are well balanced, indicating that the model is reliable in both identifying the correct class and covering the majority of relevant instances within each class. The f1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, further confirms the model's robustness. This model can be considered highly effective for credit score classification tasks in real-world financial scenarios.
